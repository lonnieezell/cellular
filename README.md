# Cellular

Live Cells for CodeIgniter 4

## Introduction

Cellular allows backend developers to create interactive web applications without any front-end javascript framework requied. Instead, all of the interaction is handled by sending requests back to the server, where components are updated and the results are placed back in place in the HTML. All using an extended version of CodeIgniter's [View Cells](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/outgoing/view_cells.html).

Heavily inspired by [Pheonix Liveview](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), and [Symfony Live Components](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-live-component/current/index.html).

NOTE: This has just started development. Don't expect anything soon.
